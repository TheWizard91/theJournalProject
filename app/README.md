This app is just a simple blog (inspired by Meta Platform’s (f. k. a. Facebook) social media app Instagram) that allows users to create and modify an account, post Images, comment on them, and like them. 
I used Google Cloud Platforms’ stack to store and retrieve data. 
I am talking about the Firebase infrastructure for the backend and database. 
In addition, various APIs and open-source projects (mainly from the android developers community) are found on GitHub to enhance the user experience with the application. 
Please refer to this link to see the stack used. 
Here is a video of the app working: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ5RKINgkx0&t=8s
